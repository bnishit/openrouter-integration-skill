# OpenRouter Skill

Ship OpenRouter work without rebuilding it.

An installable skill that gives AI agents model discovery, image generation, cost tracking, routing, and production playbooks — so you stop rewriting the same OpenRouter patterns.

Landing page: [bnishit.github.io/openrouter-skill](https://bnishit.github.io/openrouter-skill/)

## Install

```bash
npx skills add bnishit/openrouter-skill
```

Works with any AI agent that supports the skills install flow.

## Alternative Install

Direct git clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bnishit/openrouter-skill.git
```

The package/repo name is `openrouter-skill`. The installed skill trigger is `openrouter-integration`.

## Why This Exists

OpenRouter moves faster than app code usually does. New models appear quickly, providers differ, and pricing shifts underneath existing flows. Teams end up redoing the same integration steps every time. This skill bundles those recurring patterns into one installable layer.

## Capabilities

- **Model Discovery** — searchable catalog patterns, filtering guidance, and picker-ready UI examples
- **Provider & Free Models** — provider-aware filters and zero-priced model discovery from the live catalog
- **Multimodal Chat** — text, image, and PDF request patterns with response parsing and streaming
- **Image Generation** — chat-completions patterns for generated images, output modalities, and response parsing
- **Generation Costs** — exact post-hoc lookup for cost, provider, and token accounting per generation
- **Tool Calling** — loop-safe examples for tools, follow-up calls, and structured response handling
- **Routing & Fallbacks** — provider routing, fallback strategies, and parameter-aware request configuration
- **Production Playbooks** — built-in rules for routing, observability, structured output, logging, and audit
- **Asset Workflows** — starter patterns for icons, OG images, social visuals, and persistent asset metadata
- **Starter Templates** — reusable Next.js and Express routes plus a small ops/debug surface
- **Safer Defaults** — starter proxies reject arbitrary remote image/PDF URLs unless you explicitly allowlist trusted hosts
- **Verification** — smoke fixtures, docs checks, and shared helpers for safer integration changes

## Example Prompts

- `Use $openrouter-integration to add an OpenRouter model picker to this app.`
- `Use $openrouter-integration to add provider and free-model filters to this OpenRouter model catalog.`
- `Use $openrouter-integration to fetch a completed OpenRouter generation and show its exact cost.`
- `Use $openrouter-integration to add image generation plus image and PDF chat support through an OpenRouter server route.`
- `Use $openrouter-integration to generate OG images and app icons through OpenRouter, preview them, and store the approved assets cleanly.`
- `Use $openrouter-integration to make this OpenRouter workflow production-safe with the built-in best-practice playbooks for routing, tools, and observability.`
- `Use $openrouter-integration to wire tool calling and provider fallback handling into this project.`

## First Principles

1. **Model markets change quickly** — you need discovery, provider awareness, and safe routing built in
2. **Compatibility is the reason teams choose OpenRouter** — one layer for text, vision, image-gen, and files
3. **Cost matters after the request, not just before it** — exact generation lookup for billing and debugging
4. **Scaffolding should not be rebuilt every project** — starter routes and request shapes are the same across projects
5. **Production rules are learned the hard way — once** — fallbacks, tool-loop safety, and cost logging should be encoded upfront
6. **Agents need structured knowledge, not just API docs** — a skill tells an agent when to use endpoints and how to handle edge cases

## How It Works

### 01 — Shipping fast on a new model

A new image-capable model just appeared. The skill fetches the live catalog, filters by modality, scaffolds the route, and keeps the integration OpenRouter-compatible — no vendor lock-in.

### 02 — Cost clarity after the fact

Yesterday's OCR flow cost more than expected. The skill looks up the generation by ID, returns exact cost, provider, and token fields — wired into logs or admin UI.

### 03 — Low-cost and fallback-conscious builds

You want a workflow that starts cheap and uses free models when possible. The skill filters zero-priced models, lists providers, preserves routing controls, and scaffolds the endpoints your app needs.

### 04 — One path for text, vision, and images

You don't want one SDK for chat, another for images, and a third for file workflows. The skill keeps the app on one OpenRouter-compatible layer across all modalities.

### 05 — Icons and OG images without custom workflows

You need app icons and OG images but don't want to rebuild prompts, preview handling, and asset metadata every time. The skill uses shipped presets and persists with generation metadata.

### 06 — Production rules without rediscovering them

The feature is working, but you don't want to remember all the small rules for fallbacks, tool loops, and cost logging. The skill applies shipped best-practice playbooks so implementation covers the operational rules teams usually learn the hard way.

The starter proxies default to `data:` URLs for uploaded assets and block arbitrary remote `http(s)` image/PDF URLs unless you set `OPENROUTER_ALLOWED_REMOTE_ASSET_HOSTS`.

## FAQ

### Is this only for one assistant?

No. The repository is packaged broadly for AI agents that support the skills install flow. The landing page is intentionally written for general agent use.

### What makes this an agent skill?

It packages reusable OpenRouter workflows, templates, references, and helper assets so an AI agent can apply them directly instead of rebuilding the same integration patterns from scratch.

### What do I get besides docs?

The skill prompt, metadata, starter templates, smoke fixtures, shared helpers, and focused references plus best-practice playbooks for models, providers, image generation, tool loops, and generation cost lookup.

### Does this replace the OpenRouter SDK?

No. This skill complements it. The SDK handles HTTP calls and auth. This skill handles the decision layer above it — which model to pick, how to route, what to do when things fail, and how to audit costs after the fact.

### How do I keep the skill updated?

Pull the latest from the repo or re-run `npx skills add bnishit/openrouter-skill`. The skill is versioned in Git, so you can diff changes and decide when to update.

### Can I use this with my own prompts and templates?

Yes. The skill provides defaults and best-practice patterns, but everything is editable. Override templates, swap playbook rules, or extend the skill with your own workflows.

## Maintenance

Treat official OpenRouter documentation as the source of truth for endpoints, parameters, and capability metadata.

Use:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_openrouter_docs.py --quick
```

When the script flags drift, update the templates and examples against the relevant OpenRouter documentation.
